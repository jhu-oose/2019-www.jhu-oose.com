# Opportunities for Extra Points

**⚠️  We only consider work done during the course—we don’t award extra points for work you’ve done before the course started.**

## Contribute to an Open-Source Project

The contribution may be something as simple as fixing a typo on the `README.md` or as sophisticated as a new feature. Your contribution doesn’t have to be accepted by the maintainers, though it’s better if it is. We’ll evaluate your contribution and award extra points accordingly. If you’re looking for an open-source project to contribute to, we recommend the [the course’s projects](https://github.com/jhu-oose) (including the website you’re reading right now), and the tools in the [Toolbox](/toolbox), most of which are open-source. [Javalin](/toolbox#web-server-javalin) is particularly welcoming to new contributors, and [we have contributed to it already](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/commits?author=leafac). Submit your open-source contribution to our consideration by opening an issue in your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.

## Participate in a Forum

This may be either the forum in the [Students Area](https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-students){:data-proofer-ignore="true"} <small title="You must be a registered student logged into GitHub to see this.">🔒</small> or forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and mailing lists for open-source projects—just don’t ask questions about [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments) in these public spaces. We’ll evaluate your participation and you’ll be award extra points for particularly [insightful and well-crafted](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) questions and answers. Submit your outstanding contribution in a forum to our consideration by opening an issue in your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.

## Do Something Outstanding for the Community

Promote an event to help bring underrepresented groups to computer science, write a blog post showing how to solve a technical problem, record a vlog commenting on your experience in this course, and so forth. We’ll evaluate your contribution and award you extra points based on quality and impact. Submit your outstanding contribution to our consideration by opening an issue in your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.

## Do Something Creative and Fun

Write a song about how it’s like to take OOSE, make a dance number about design patterns, draw a comic strip about refactoring… We’ll evaluate your art piece and award you extra points based on how much it makes us laugh and glad to be alive. Submit your art piece to our consideration by opening an issue in your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.
