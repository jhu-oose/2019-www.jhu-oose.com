[![Main Workflow Status](https://github.com/jhu-oose/www.jhu-oose.com/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jhu-oose/www.jhu-oose.com/actions)

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

There are a few pages that aren’t part of the website, and are meant to be used during the class:

- `/selector`: Select a random item from a list. We used this during class to select a group who’d help discuss something.

- `/timer`: A countdown timer. We used this during the quiz to show how much time students had left and some clarifications for commonly asked questions.
