[![Main Workflow Status](https://github.com/jhu-oose/www.jhu-oose.com/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jhu-oose/www.jhu-oose.com/actions)

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

There are a few pages that aren’t part of the website, and are meant to be used during the class:

- `/selector`: Select a random item from a list. We used this during class to select a group who’d help discuss something.

- `/timer`: A countdown timer. We used this during the quiz to show how much time students had left and some clarifications for commonly asked questions.

# TODO

- Draw figures for the Iterations. The figures would be like building something (say, a car). On the first Iteration there’s only the idea of a car (say, a thought bubble). On the second there’s a blueprint. On the third there are wheels. And so forth.
- Render a calendar view of the office hours to make them easier to see. The current view is just listing all the times people are available, which is good for when you want to talk to particular staff member, but is bad for when you just want to go to someone’s office hours.
