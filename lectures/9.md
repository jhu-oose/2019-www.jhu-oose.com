# Lecture 9: Other Programming Paradigms

**<small>ðŸš§</small>Â Â Work in ProgressÂ Â <small>ðŸš§</small>**

# Other Object-Oriented Programming Systems

- Basic principles of object-oriented programming, for example, encapsulation, inheritance, and composition
- How these principles are implemented (or not) in Java and in JavaScript, for example, encapsulation is more difficult in JavaScript
- Prototype-based systems
- Inheritance in other languages
- Monkey patching
- Objects that arenâ€™t from classes
- Traits & mixins
- Stuff from Scala
- Rubyâ€™s singleton classes

# Functional Programming

- Higher-Order Functions
- Immutability
- How React works
- The expression problem
- How functional features are making their way into programming languages that were traditionally object-oriented (not only the features are available, but theyâ€™re actually used)
- Idempotence: Like the ItemsRepository constructor

# Other Goofy Paradigms

- Relational Programming: AutoLayout in iOS

# Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)

# Regular Expressions

- https://xkcd.com/208/
- Now you have two problems
- When _not_ to use them, for example, to parse HTML.

- IntelliJ cheat sheet

- Reluctant operators

- Using regex in a programming language

# Other Topics

- Testing
  - Different kinds of tests (smoke, acceptance, system, integration, unit, regression) (manual, automated)
  - Donâ€™t overtest
  - Code coverage
  - When to write tests (with produce owner, before coding, after coding)
  - Order-independence
  - UI Testing (snapshoting)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Fix the pooling with either server-sent events (SSE), websockets, or long pooling
