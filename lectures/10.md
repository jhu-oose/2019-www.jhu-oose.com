## Defining Open Source

- Software Ownership and Distribution
- Code
- Community

## Parts of an Open Source Project

- Vision
	- Why is your project important?
	- Is it at a stage it can be open sourced?
	- Where do you see your project in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years?
- Motivation to open source your work
	- Community should get to use a software
	- Can be a gateway for jobs
- Governance Models
	- BDFL (e.g., Guido van Rossum for [Python](https://www.python.org), Linus Torvalds for [Linux](https://www.linux.org))
	- Committes (e.g., [Inkspace](https://inkscape.org), [Debian](https://www.debian.org))
	- Companies (e.g., [React](https://reactjs.org) by Facebook)
- Technical Aspects
	- Working with legacy code
	- Following issues and PR templates
	- Code specifications and standards for each project
