- Weâ€™re continuing the implementation of the feature from [LectureÂ 4](/lectures/4).
- Now weâ€™re working on the tests and the client.
- See the [Issue](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/issues/24), its corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25), and the [project board](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/projects/3) (look at Iteration 4).

# Tests

- Weâ€™re covering three kinds of tests:
  1. JUnit tests.
     - For the _models_. The **M** in MVC. The things you include in a class diagram.
  2. Postman tests.
     - For the whole server. Postman pretends to be a browser and acts as the client. This exercises the router, the controllers, the repositories, the database, and so forth.
  3. Manual tests on the browser.
     - This tests the client.
- Automated tests are like an autograder that you wish you had for [AssignmentÂ 4](/assignments/4).
- There are many more kinds of tests that we arenâ€™t covering, for example, there are ways to test the client without having to open the browser and click around.
- Good tests:
  - Are independent of order.
  - Serve as runnable documentation of how the application works.
  - Cover all the features (which you can measure with code coverage tools).
  - Donâ€™t go overboard with complicated setup.

# Client

- See the [wireframe](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/46d406a0a4246f77a615e5ae939b4a6de25d2095/docs/wireframes.jpeg).
- We cover the most important aspects of React:
  - Defining components as functions or classes.
  - Using components with JSX.
  - Moving back and forth between JavaScript and what looks like HTML in JSX (but actually are function calls).
  - Props.
  - State.
  - Event handlers.

# Announcements

- Thereâ€™s a [poll open](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-students/issues/41){:data-proofer-ignore="true"}Â <small title="You must be a registered student logged into GitHub to see this.">ðŸ”’</small> for the topics of [LectureÂ 6](/lectures/6).
- Weâ€™re scheduling the [final presentations for the group projects](/group-projects#presentations). You must answer with your availability on the issue created by Roboose on your groupâ€™s repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-group-<identifier>`.
