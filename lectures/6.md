# Mounting

You go from regular HTML to React with:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(«React HTML-like tags», «An element from the existing HTML»);
```

for example:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<Game/>, document.querySelector("#game"));
```

You can do this several times with different elements from the existing HTML.

# JSX

We aren’t writing on pure JavaScript, but on an extension of JavaScript called JSX. The difference is that in JSX we can write HTML interspersed with JavaScript.

## Going from JavaScript to HTML

Just use an HTML tag somewhere in the JavaScript, for example:

```jsx
const aButton = <button>I’m a button</button>;
```

## Going from HTML back to JavaScript

Delimit the JavaScript with `{}`, for example:

```jsx
const thirdButton = <button>I’m button number {1 + 2}</button>;
```

In the example above, the `<button>___</button>` means “go to HTML,” as mentioned above. And the `{1 + 2}` means “go back to JavaScript.” The result is that the `1 + 2` is computed in JavaScript and the `thirdButton` will read `I’m button number 3`.

# React Components

A React component is a new kind of HTML tag.

To tell a React component apart from an HTML tag, look at the first letter: a React component starts with a capital letter (for example, `Game`), while an HTML tag starts with a lowercase letter (for example, `button`).

A React component may include HTML tags or other React components.

A React component may be defined with a function or a class that inherits from `React.Component` and defines a method called `render()`. For example:

```jsx
function AReactComponentDefinedWithAFunction() {
    return <button>I’m a React Component</button>;
}

class AnotherReactComponentDefinedWithAClass extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <button>I’m another React Component</button>;
    }
}
```

To use a React component, refer to it as if it were an HTML tag, for example, `<AReactComponentDefinedWithAFunction/>`.

A React component must return _exactly one_ tag. If you need to return multiple tags, wrap them in another tag, for example:

```jsx
// ⚠️  This doesn’t work!
function MyTwoButtons() {
    return (
        <button>I’m a button 1</button>
        <button>And I’m a button 2</button>
    );
}

// 👍  But this does!
function MyTwoButtons() {
    return (
        <div>
            <button>I’m a button 1</button>
            <button>And I’m a button 2</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The parenthesis after the `return` keyword is mandatory because of JavaScript’s [Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Automatic_semicolon_insertion).

# Props

Props are arguments passed to the component, similar to how you can pass arguments when calling a function.

When a component is defined with a function, the props are the only function argument, for example:

```jsx
function MyButton(props) {
    return <button>I’m button number {props.number}</button>
}
```

When a component is defined with a class, the props are available as an object attribute, for example:

```jsx
class MyButton extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <button>I’m button number {this.props.number}</button>
    }
}
```

To pass props to the component when using it, use HTML-like properties, for example:

```jsx
const thirdButton = <MyButton number={1 + 2}/>;
```

Props must never be changed from within the component, for example:

```jsx
// ⚠️  Don’t change props
function MyButton(props) {
    props.number = 4; // ⚠️
    return <button>I’m button number {props.number}</button>
}
```

Props flow from the parent component to its children, never the other way around.

# State

State is like mutable object attributes. For example, in Java you may have:

```java
class Person {
    private String name = "Roboose";
    private int age = 28;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and so forth...
}
```

and you can use setters to change `name` and `age`, for example:

```java
person.setAge(29);
```

An equivalent React component reads like:

```jsx
class Person extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { name: "Roboose", age: 28 };
    }

    render() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

and you can use `setState()` to update the state, for example:

```jsx
person.setState({ age: 29 });
```

You must never change the state directly:

```jsx
// ⚠️  Don’t change the state directly
person.state.age = 29;
```

That’s because React must re-render the component when the state is updated. React can’t detect direct changes to the state, but it can detect changes to the state made through `setState()`.

Under the hood, what’s happening is that React is calling `render()` on the component anytime its state changes. Also, it’s smart enough to only re-render the children that changed, for example, if `Person` includes a child component `Name` that doesn’t depend on `age`, then the `setState({ age: 29 })` above will not re-render `Name`.

**<small>👉</small>  The main feature in React, and the reason why we use it, is this capability of detecting changes and only re-rendering what’s necessary. Without React we’d need to find what data goes where and update everything by hand—and if we missed something things would go out of sync.**

# Events

Events are things like the user clicking on a button, data arriving from the server, a certain amount of time having passed, and so forth.

We handle events in React in a similar way we’d handle them in HTML, for example:

```jsx
function MyButton() {
    return (
        <button onClick={
          () => { alert("You clicked the button"); }
        }>
            I’m a React Component
        </button>
    );
}
```

# State Lifting

A child component can’t change the state of its parent, but sometimes that’s what we’d like to do, for example:

```jsx
class Person extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { name: "Roboose", age: 28 };
    }

    render() {
        return <BirthdayButton/>
    }
}

function BirthdayButton() {
    return (
        <button onClick={
          () => { alert("I’d like to update the age of person"); }
        }>
            Birthday
        </button>
    );
}
```

The most common technique to do this is to pass a prop to the child that is a function to update the state, for example:

```jsx
class Person extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { name: "Roboose", age: 28 };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <BirthdayButton onClick={
                () => {
                  this.setState({ age: this.state.age + 1 });
                } 
            }/>
        );
    }
}

function BirthdayButton(props) {
    return (
        <button onClick={ () => { props.onClick(); } }>
            Birthday
        </button>
    );
}
```
