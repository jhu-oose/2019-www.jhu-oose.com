# Cheat Sheet

You may bring one sheet of paper, 8.5â€³Â Ã—Â 11â€³, handwritten by you, front and back, with whatever information you want. You must turn in the cheat sheet with the quiz.

# What is the Quiz About?

Everything we did in the course, including the topics in the [course material](/#course-material), [lectures & lecture notes](/#lectures), [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments), and [group projects](/#group-projects). The quiz also covers topics from the lecture notes that we asked you to read about but havenâ€™t covered in lectures or assignments, for example, [Fluent Interfaces](/lectures/3#fluent-interface).

# How Difficult is the Quiz?

About the same level of difficulty as the [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments). But the quiz is shorter than an assignment: itâ€™s designed to take approximately 45 minutes out of the 75 minutes you have to complete it. Also, unlike assignments the quiz doesnâ€™t require you to do any research and learn new topics on your own.

# What Kinds of Questions Are Asked in the Quiz?

Most questions ask you to write, draw diagrams, and so forth. Some questions may be multiple choice or some other format.

# How do I Prepare for the Quiz?

1. Review the [course material](/#course-material), [lectures & lecture notes](/#lectures), [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments), and [group projects](/#group-projects).

2. Review the [Toolbox](/toolbox). In particular, review the sections called **How Do I Learn It?** and the links you find there.

3. Review the [TODOOSE video series](/todoose).

4. Review the [lectures](/#lectures). Watch the videos of the lectures.

5. Review the [lecture notes](/#lectures), including the topics that we asked you to read about but havenâ€™t covered in lectures or assignments, for example, [Fluent Interfaces](/lectures/3#fluent-interface).

6. Review the videos that we published after every assignment was due showing how to work on the assignment (for example, [hereâ€™s the video for AssignmentÂ 1](/assignments/1#working-on-the-assignment)).

7. Review the process for collaborating on the [group projects](/#group-projects) using GitHub Project Boards, Issues, Pull Requests, and so forth. This is the process we used while [developing TODOOSE](/todoose), and itâ€™s based on the so-called [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

8. Ask questions on the [forum](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-students/issues){:data-proofer-ignore="true"}Â <small title="You must be a registered student logged into GitHub to see this.">ðŸ”’</small>, and talk to your colleagues and the [course staff](/staff).

9. Bring a pencil, not a pen. This is particularly important when drawing diagrams, because a clean and readable presentation is part of whatâ€™s evaluated.

# Can I Look at Previous Quizzes?

Quizzes change a lot because weâ€™re always improving and updating the course, so looking at previous quizzes would only confuse you. Instead, follow the study plan described [above](#how-do-i-prepare-for-the-quiz).
